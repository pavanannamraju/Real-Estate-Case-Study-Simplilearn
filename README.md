# Real-Estate-Case-Study-Simplilearn
Project for predicting monthly expenditures for home mortgage loans

Project Files provided by Simplilearn Edu.

Only performed some of the EDA assignments given in the case study, as the main goal was to practice model building

Performed Backward Elimination for feature selection after doing trials for Recursive Feature Elimination, Forward Selection(which I did not include in the notebook)
Also worked on Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression for other regression models.
